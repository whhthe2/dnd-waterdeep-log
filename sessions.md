### Aftermath

- One Kenku escaped the Warehouse.
- Found 15 silver bars (50 gp each)
- Found 4 paintings depicting Luskan, Neverwinter, Silverymoon and Baldur's Gate. (75 gp each)
- Ranaer Neverember agreed to join the group
- The Zhentarim's symbol is a winged snake. 
- The Xanathar Guild's symbol is a crude beholder.
- Met Captain Hyustus Staget (of the City Watch).

Learned from Ranaer Neverember that the Zhentarim thinks his father, Dagult Neverember, embezzled a large amount of gold while he was Open Lord, and that he hid the dragons somewhere in the city. They think they can find it by using an artifact called the Stone of Golorr, which was in the hands of the Xanathar Guild until recently. Apparently, someone stole it. The Zhents thought Ranaer knew something about this, but he claims to know nothing. "My father and I haven't spoken in years" he said.
